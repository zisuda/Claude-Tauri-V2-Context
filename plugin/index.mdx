Tauri comes with extensibility in mind. On this page you'll find:

- **[Official Features](#official-features)**: Built-in Tauri features and functionality
- **[Community Resources](#community-plugins)**: More plugins and recipes built by the Tauri community. You can also contribute your own on [Awesome Tauri](https://github.com/tauri-apps/awesome-tauri)
- **[Support Table](#support-table)**: A compatibility table showing which platforms are supported by each official plugin

<br />

**Use the search and filter functionality to find features or community resources:**

<Search filters={platformFilters}>
  #### Official Features
  <FeaturesList />
  #### Community Plugins
  <AwesomeTauri section="plugins-no-official" />
  #### Community Integrations
  <AwesomeTauri section="integrations" />
</Search>
