title: Embedding External Binaries
i18nReady: true
---

You may need to embed external binaries to add additional functionality to your application or prevent users from installing additional dependencies (e.g., Node.js or Python). We call this binary a `sidecar`.

Binaries are executables written in any programming language. Common use cases are Python CLI applications or API servers bundled using `pyinstaller`.

To bundle the binaries of your choice, you can add the `externalBin` property to the `tauri > bundle` object in your `tauri.conf.json`.
The `externalBin` configuration expects a list of strings targeting binaries either with absolute or relative paths.

Here is a Tauri configuration snippet to illustrate a sidecar configuration:

```json title="src-tauri/tauri.conf.json"
{
  "bundle": {
    "externalBin": [
      "/absolute/path/to/sidecar",
      "../relative/path/to/binary",
      "binaries/my-sidecar"
    ]
  }
}
```

:::note

The relative paths are relative to the `tauri.conf.json` file which is in the `src-tauri` directory.
So `binaries/my-sidecar` would represent `<PROJECT ROOT>/src-tauri/binaries/my-sidecar`.

:::

To make the external binary work on each supported architecture, a binary with the same name and a `-$TARGET_TRIPLE` suffix must exist on the specified path.
For instance, `"externalBin": ["binaries/my-sidecar"]` requires a `src-tauri/binaries/my-sidecar-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` executable on Linux or `src-tauri/binaries/my-sidecar-aarch64-apple-darwin` on Mac OS with Apple Silicon.

You can find your **current** platform's `-$TARGET_TRIPLE` suffix by running the following command:

```sh
rustc --print host-tuple
```

This directly outputs your host's target triple (e.g., `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` or `aarch64-apple-darwin`).

:::note
The `--print host-tuple` flag was added in Rust 1.84.0. If you're using an older version, you'll need to parse the output of `rustc -Vv` instead:

```sh
# Unix (Linux/macOS)
rustc -Vv | grep host | cut -f2 -d' '

# Windows PowerShell
rustc -Vv | Select-String "host:" | ForEach-Object {$_.Line.split(" ")[1]}
```

:::

Here's a Node.js script to append the target triple to a binary:

```javascript
import { execSync } from 'child_process';
import fs from 'fs';

const extension = process.platform === 'win32' ? '.exe' : '';

const targetTriple = execSync('rustc --print host-tuple').toString().trim();
if (!targetTriple) {
  console.error('Failed to determine platform target triple');
}
fs.renameSync(
  `src-tauri/binaries/sidecar${extension}`,
  `src-tauri/binaries/sidecar-${targetTriple}${extension}`
);
```

Note that this script will not work if you compile for a different architecture than the one its running on,
so only use it as a starting point for your own build scripts.

## Running it from Rust

:::note
Please follow the [shell plugin guide](/plugin/shell/) first to set up and initialize the plugin correctly.
Without the plugin being initialized and configured the example won't work.
:::

On the Rust side, import the `tauri_plugin_shell::ShellExt` trait and call the `shell().sidecar()` function on the AppHandle:

```rust
use tauri_plugin_shell::ShellExt;
use tauri_plugin_shell::process::CommandEvent;
use tauri::Emitter;

let sidecar_command = app.shell().sidecar("my-sidecar").unwrap();
let (mut rx, mut child) = sidecar_command
  .spawn()
  .expect("Failed to spawn sidecar");

tauri::async_runtime::spawn(async move {
  // read events such as stdout
  while let Some(event) = rx.recv().await {
    if let CommandEvent::Stdout(line_bytes) = event {
      let line = String::from_utf8_lossy(&line_bytes);
      app
        .emit("message", Some(format!("'{}'", line)))
        .expect("failed to emit event");
      // write to stdin
      child.write("message from Rust\n".as_bytes()).unwrap();
    }
  }
});
```

:::note
The `sidecar()` function expects just the filename, NOT the whole path configured in the `externalBin` array.

Given the following configuration:

```json title="src-tauri/tauri.conf.json"
{
  "bundle": {
    "externalBin": ["binaries/app", "my-sidecar", "../scripts/sidecar"]
  }
}
```

The appropriate way to execute the sidecar is by calling `app.shell().sidecar(name)` where `name` is either `"app"`, `"my-sidecar"` or `"sidecar"`
instead of `"binaries/app"` for instance.

:::

You can place this code inside a Tauri command to easily pass the AppHandle or you can store a reference to the AppHandle in the builder script to access it elsewhere in your application.

## Running it from JavaScript

When running the sidecar, Tauri requires you to give the sidecar permission to run the `execute` or `spawn` method on the child process. To grant this permission, go to the file `<PROJECT ROOT>/src-tauri/capabilities/default.json` and add the section below to the permissions array. Don't forget to name your sidecar according to the relative path mentioned earlier.

```json title="src-tauri/capabilities/default.json" ins={4-12}
{
  "permissions": [
    "core:default",
    {
      "identifier": "shell:allow-execute",
      "allow": [
        {
          "name": "binaries/app",
          "sidecar": true
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

:::note

The `shell:allow-execute` identifier is used because the sidecar's child process will be started using the `command.execute()` method. To run it with `command.spawn()`, you need to change the identifier to `shell:allow-spawn` or add another entry to the array with the same structure as the one above, but with the identifier set to `shell:allow-spawn`.

:::

In the JavaScript code, import the `Command` class from the `@tauri-apps/plugin-shell` module and use the `sidecar` static method.

```javascript
import { Command } from '@tauri-apps/plugin-shell';
const command = Command.sidecar('binaries/my-sidecar');
const output = await command.execute();
```

:::note
The string provided to `Command.sidecar` must match one of the strings defined in the `externalBin` configuration array.
:::

## Passing arguments

You can pass arguments to Sidecar commands just like you would for running normal [Command][std::process::Command].

Arguments can be either **static** (e.g. `-o` or `serve`) or **dynamic** (e.g. `<file_path>` or `localhost:<PORT>`). A value of `true` will allow any arguments to be passed to the command. `false` will disable all arguments. If neither `true` or `false` is set, you define the arguments in the exact order in which you'd call them. Static arguments are defined as-is, while dynamic arguments can be defined using a regular expression.

First, define the arguments that need to be passed to the sidecar command in `src-tauri/capabilities/default.json`:

```json title="src-tauri/capabilities/default.json" ins={8-24}
{
  "$schema": "../gen/schemas/desktop-schema.json",
  "identifier": "default",
  "description": "Capability for the main window",
  "windows": ["main"],
  "permissions": [
    "core:default",
    {
      "identifier": "shell:allow-execute",
      "allow": [
        {
          "args": [
            "arg1",
            "-a",
            "--arg2",
            {
              "validator": "\\S+"
            }
          ],
          "name": "binaries/my-sidecar",
          "sidecar": true
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

:::note
If you are migrating from Tauri v1, the `migrate` command in Tauri v2 CLI should take care of this for you. Read [Automated Migration](/start/migrate/from-tauri-1/#automated-migration) for more.
:::

Then, to call the sidecar command, simply pass in **all** the arguments as an array.

In Rust:

```rust
use tauri_plugin_shell::ShellExt;
#[tauri::command]
async fn call_my_sidecar(app: tauri::AppHandle) {
  let sidecar_command = app
    .shell()
    .sidecar("my-sidecar")
    .unwrap()
    .args(["arg1", "-a", "--arg2", "any-string-that-matches-the-validator"]);
  let (mut _rx, mut _child) = sidecar_command.spawn().unwrap();
}
```

In JavaScript:

```javascript
import { Command } from '@tauri-apps/plugin-shell';
// notice that the args array matches EXACTLY what is specified in `capabilities/default.json`.
const command = Command.sidecar('binaries/my-sidecar', [
  'arg1',
  '-a',
  '--arg2',
  'any-string-that-matches-the-validator',
]);
const output = await command.execute();
```
